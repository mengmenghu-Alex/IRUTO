#IRUTO: Image Restoration under Transformer Oil Based on Physical Modeling and Color Prior Constraints
This repository provides the dataset and code implementation for the paper "Image Restoration under Transformer Oil Based on Physical Modeling and Color Prior Constraints". The project focuses on restoring images captured under transformer oil environments, using a combination of physical modeling and color prior constraints.

Dataset and Code Availability
The dataset and the full code implementation are currently being organized and will be uploaded once finalized. Please stay tuned for updates!
